# BGG_plays_to_Sheets
BGG_plays_to_Sheets pulls play data from boardgamegeek (www.boardgamegeek.com) into a Google Sheets document.  The first time you run the script, you will need to edit the variables at the beginning of the main.py file.  The script will start with the date you select as the oldest date, and will pull in all of the games from there.  After the first pull, the script looks to see what the most recent game was that was added to the spreadsheet, and adds all of the plays which are newer.
